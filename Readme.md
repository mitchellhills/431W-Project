Welcome to Mitchell Hills's 431W Project: NHL Game Database Command Line Interface Program

This repository contains the python script that the user will use to interact with the NHL Game Database Command Line Interface Program located in "431W Project Code.py". PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and the psycopg2 package was used to implement this program where the data originally came from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinellis/nhl-game-data?select=team_info.csv. The original data from Kaggle was cleansed, modified, and then reduced so that the data could be imported into pgAdmin and uploaded to GitHub. The latest version of PostgreSQL can be downloaded from https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ and psycopg2 can be installed by running "pip install psycopg2" in the windows command prompt. You can find all the database tables, in CSV format, necessary to run the NHL Game Database Command Line Interface Program located in the "Database Tables" folder.
